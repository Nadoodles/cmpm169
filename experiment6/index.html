			<h1>Experiment 6: Grammars & Text Art</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>When this assignment was posted, the first thing that came to mind was the art I would see on YouTube. 
					They would use words as the filling for the art. In the example, the bottom level would use more words, use a darker, 
					or move the letters closer to create an image where it was colored in. As for the colors on top, they would use a lighter color, 
					or wouldn’t use the pen as hard to create the art. So for this assignment, I want to create something like this. Hopefully, 
					what I can do is pixelize the image, and then use each pixel as a word. Hopefully this works, we’ll see. 
				</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>For now, I’m just adding the image to the canvas. 


					The next thing that I’m going to do is to try to incorporate text into the image. To do this, 
					I’ve gained inspiration from this, https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/P_4_3_2_01.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Step 1:</strong> The first thing that I am going to do is pixelate the image. After pixelating the image, I am going to try to make each pixel a word, or a group of pixels a word.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Step 2:</strong> The next thing that I’m going to do is to try to incorporate text into the image. To do this, I’ve gained inspiration from this, <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/P_4_3_2_01">https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/P_4_3_2_01</a>. Thanks to the code, each pixel was changed into a word. Obviously, I can’t use this as my own, but my plan is to
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Step 3:</strong> I don’t know if it's seen, but the words on the character read, “This is going to be used temporarily.” Instead of this, I am going to try to use tracery.
						<p><em>// Failure, could not load in the tracery. I tried doing what the TA suggested, but nothing worked. For now, I will ignore tracery and work on some type of animation.</em></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Step 4:</strong> One thing that I am going to do is switch to different pictures, just so that we have different art. As of right now, the images can be switched by pressing 0, 1, 2, as these are the indexes for the images.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this assignment independently. When this assignment was presented, 
					I remembered watching YouTube videos of artists creating landscapes, portraits, and images using words as a 
					drawing mechanism instead of coloring, painting, or drawing. It caught my attention, so in this assignment, 
					I attempted to recreate it with three art models of anime characters. While I utilized ChatGPT to address some bugs, 
					the majority of the work is my own. I dedicated numerous hours to coding, seeking feedback, and opinions from friends along the way. 
					The most challenging part was incorporating Tracery. However, it didn’t work out, and I completely removed it from the plan. It’s not an issue, 
					but since the images are large and take a while to load, when you press either 0, 1, or 2, please take into consideration that it may take some 
					time for the image to load. There’s no issue with the code; it just takes a long time to create the art.
