				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I was inspired by the professor’s example during class, where he had a tornado as an image background, and teapots going in a circular rotation. I don’t have the image, but I am going to include a picture of a tornado. So the 3D art that I want to do is have 3D objects of sheep (from Blender) jumping over a fence, which would help the user fall asleep. To include another form of 3D art, I’ll create a sphere that rotates in a circular motion. 
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>For now, I added the blender object to the p5.js project. I intended to add a green rectangle at the bottom of the screen, but I am still trying to figure out how to do that. Not only that, I tried adding a sphere to the project, but every time I did it, it would combine with the sheep, which was not the plan. 


					After including the sheep model, I now have a night background. I genuinely like how this came out, so what I am going to do in step three is make it so that I can spawn multiple sheep. Hopefully, after that, they can jump over the forest, to mimic the sheep jumping over the fence. 
					</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Step 1: Adding multiple sheep. I want to do this so that I can have multiple sheep running over the forest. For now, I just want to spawn the sheep.
					</li>
					<li>
						Step 2: I want to make the sheep move from left to right. After that, I want the position to reposition itself. However, after it reaches the end of the screen/canvas, they don’t restart. That’s definitely something I have to do for the next step.
					</li>
					<li>
						Step 3: The sheep start at the far left screen now. Instead of relocating the sheep back to the original position, I have 100 sheep spawn, and they will slowly move across the screen over time.
					</li>
					<li>
						Step 4: The sheep jump up and down now. I’m not able to show the picture of them jumping up and down, but they start low. In the next step, I want to start the sheep starting at the grass and then have them jumping up and down.
					</li>
					<li>
						Step 5: The sheep oscillate up and down with the correct initial position. The next step is to add music, and I will be happy with the assignment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Step 6: I added music and am thinking of adding a moon to the right corner just to add more 3D animations.
					</li>
					<li>
						Step 7: I added a moon. What I did was create a sphere, make it rotate, and download a texture from NASA's website.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this assignment independently. I was inspired by the fact that when I was starting this assignment, I was really tired, so the first thing that came to my mind was counting sheep with a goodnight song. The blender object of the sheep was bought, and the moon was originally a sphere with a moon PNG. While I utilized ChatGPT to address some bugs, the majority of the work is my own. I dedicated numerous hours to coding, seeking feedback and opinions from friends along the way. The most challenging part of the project was attempting to create the background scenery. Every time I tried to create a rectangle box, for some reason, it wouldn’t allow me. After multiple tries, I gave up on the rectangle box and looked up an image of a grass field during nighttime. Another issue I had was positioning issues, but it was resolved when I tried many values. In the end, I am pleased with the result, and I believe I have done a commendable job on this assignment.
