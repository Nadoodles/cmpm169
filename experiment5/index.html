				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I was inspired by the professor’s example during class, where he had a tornado as an image background, and teapots going in a circular rotation. I don’t have the image, but I am going to include a picture of a tornado. So the 3D art that I want to do is have 3D objects of sheep (from Blender) jumping over a fence, which would help the user fall asleep. To include another form of 3D art, I’ll create a sphere that rotates in a circular motion. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>For now, I added the blender object to the p5.js project. I intended to add a green rectangle at the bottom of the screen, but I am still trying to figure out how to do that. Not only that, I tried adding a sphere to the project, but every time I did it, it would combine with the sheep, which was not the plan. 


					After including the sheep model, I now have a night background. I genuinely like how this came out, so what I am going to do in step three is make it so that I can spawn multiple sheep. Hopefully, after that, they can jump over the forest, to mimic the sheep jumping over the fence. 
					</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
				</ul>
