			<h1>Experiment 2 -Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>
					Initially, when this assignment was given to us, I assumed that we had to create some cool vector animation, 
					but I didn’t realize that we had to create art. The art I wanted to create was fireworks that you would see at a festival 
					in Japan. I have some experience with JavaScript, but I never had any skills for creativity. With that in mind, 
					I believe that I can do this.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>

					The thing I wanted to start with is to create some type of firework animation. Unfortunately, when I click on the screen, it creates circles that encircle the initial circle. This isn’t something that I want.

					In the next prototype, as shown in the image, when I click on the screen, it leaves a trail upwards, but it doesn’t go anywhere else and then disappears. I want to change this because I want it to explode upwards and then leave a trail downwards.
					
					Expanding upon the idea of creating a firework animation, it is essential to consider various techniques and strategies. By learning from existing approaches, we can establish a solid foundation. Building upon this foundation involves the amalgamation of elements from different sources. This may include combining features from various programming languages, exploring unconventional uses of libraries or frameworks, or integrating techniques from diverse fields or disciplines.

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Step 1: Every time I click on the screen, a circle will spawn (random color) and it will disappear after a while.</li>
			
					<li>Step 2: I saw this code <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?02_M/M_6_1_01">link</a> and I am interested in using this visual when I click the ball. So in my second step, when I click the screen, unfortunately, the nodes spawn, but then the circle spawns afterwards. I want to change it so that when I click the circle, the nodes spawn on the circle.</li>
			
					<li>Step 4: I changed it so that when it clicks, the nodes would spawn off the circles. As shown in the picture, only one node will spawn.</li>
			
					<li>Step 5: When clicked, more nodes spawn, however once I click again, the nodes of the previous firework would automatically change it to the color of the next firework. Next step is to fix that.</li>
			
					<li>Step 6: Circles are smaller, and every firework I click is distinctly different from each other.</li>
			
					<li>Step 7: When the player presses “W”, it creates waves at the bottom of the screen.</li>
			
					<li>Final Step Added: When I press E, it erases waves, and when I press S, it spawns small stars on the screen.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					I worked on the assignment on my own. I used ChatGPT and nodes class from the link I shared earlier in this document. Throughout the process, I successfully implemented two distinct vector art and animation features, which I consider a notable achievement. However, the journey was not without challenges, as I encountered numerous bugs that required careful debugging and problem-solving. Despite the difficulties, the experience deepened my understanding of animation techniques in JavaScript and honed my skills in troubleshooting and refining code for a more seamless user experience.
