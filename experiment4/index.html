                <h2>Imitate</h2>
                <p>For this prototype, I want to create something similar to the GameCube intro when you start up the system and add it to an image, different from the GameCube logo. 
                    https://youtube.com/shorts/tTgALXEKe2Y?si=-pGuD4Upv90rtmXW
                    
                    The image that I want to use is a logo for the organization that I am part of in school, which is SHPE UCSC. I genuinely don’t know how to start this, but I believe this will be a good challenge. 
                    
                    
                    </p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Integrate</h2>
                <p>So originally, I want to start off with this example, with the distorted image, https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1020961. I added the logo and got this. 


                    The image is distorted, but only some of the pixels of the image are moving. After a few adjustments, I was able to create this: The image is altered differently and everything moves on its own. This is a good starting point, </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Innovate</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Reveal the image from top to bottom. I know it doesn’t show in the screenshot, but the image does reveal itself from top to bottom.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Animation happens continuously, so once the animation finishes, the image vanishes and reappears again from top to bottom.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Made the boxes bigger, so that I can start the animation.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> It’s not shown on the picture, but the pixels can now rotate.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> After it reaches from top to bottom, it stops rotating, then it restarts from top to bottom.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> I added sound. So when the animation starts, it has a built-up sound. Once the animation finishes, it makes a different sound. In order to play the sound, you have to click on the screen. This also starts the animation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I worked on this assignment independently, drawing inspiration from my love for the GameCube and my dedication to the organization of which I am the president. The image I used is from the organization, and I aimed to create a captivating animation for it. While I utilized ChatGPT to address some bugs, the majority of the work is my own. I dedicated numerous hours to coding, seeking feedback and opinions from friends along the way.
                    The most challenging part of the project was attempting to recreate something akin to the GameCube intro, where a box rolls around. However, this proved to be too difficult. Instead, I opted for an animation where pixels appear from top to bottom, accompanied by a sound effect. In the end, I am pleased with the result, and I believe I have done a commendable job on this assignment.
