				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<ul>
					<li> I shared it in the Google doc, but I started with ChatGPT. LIke shown during lecture, I asked the chat what p5.js and asked to give me an exampmle code. From there
						it gave me a circle that would follow the cursor. From there I knew I could play around with this and make it the start of my
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<ul>
					<li> My main inspiration came from CMPM 170 when we had to create a one click game using the crisp gaming library (Javascript). In this game, a box would go up and down and there will be an enemy shooting at the player. The bullets were randomized, so the player didn't know when
						a bullet would come. So, in this small demo, I changed it so that every time I clicked on the screen, a random ball would pop up. It was slightly similar to the sense that something random would show. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						From the beginning, I asked ChatGPT to create a simple code that incorporates p5.js. In return, it gave me a a gray circle that would follow the cursor. As a result, I wanted to use this so that every time I clicked the canvas, something random would show up. From the classes that I've worked on before, majority of roles consisted of some type of AI generated, or random generation. 
						from CMPM 170, I created an enemy that would randomly shoot at the player, in CMPM 125, I created random generated terrains and enemies. So, in this assignment, to start of my p5.js journey, I wanted to make it so that every time I clicked on the canvas, somoething random would happen every time. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed: </li>
					<ul>
						<li>For this assignment, I worked on it by myself. For future assignments, I do plan on working with a partner or a friend from class. As of right now, 
							I completed this assignment on my own.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I've worked with JavaScript before and this was interesting to work on. Definitely something I haven't done, the only thing similar that I can think of is CMPM 120. 
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Learning how to be creative.
