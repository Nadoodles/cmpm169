				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>Prior to starting the assignment, I was looking through different types of generative art. As I was doing research, 
					I came across the two images shown above. From the second picture, I believe that there are several lines starting in 
					the center and then they rotate at different angles, potentially random angles. 
					The left image definitely has central circles that spasm outwards. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>For starters, I am going to use this code, http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_1_1_04 and expand on it. 


					So far, there’s only one, and the image is set in the center. The lines moves outwards and randomly, 
					which I like, but I will definitely update it over time. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Step 1: One thing that I added is make the art shrink and expand. The reason why I did this is because in the art that I was inspired by, everything was different. There was no regularity, so starting on this one, I figured I should know how to resize the art. I promise, the images aren’t expanded on docs, they resize in the code. </li>
					<li> Step 2:  In this step, I create multiple of these generative art, that are spaced randomly in the canvas.</li>
					<li> Step 3: They’re all different sizes now. IN this step, I just made sure that all the circle sizes are different. </li>
					<li> Step 4: Instead of having a default 5 shapes, it makes one by one every 5 seconds, up to 20 shapes. I definitely want to have this as a starting point, and maybe after 20 seconds, it can disperse and make a new generative art. There’s also random colors for each shape. </li>
					<li> Step 5: After 5 seconds, 20 new shapes are formed with different colors and locations.</li>
					<li> Step 6: I changed it so that it’s more frequent, and instead of waiting 5 seconds, if you click on the screen, you can change into new shapes, colors and locations. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this assignment on my own, and the design was inspired by Google Images of generative art. I did use ChatGPT to fix some bugs, but that's about it. I believe I did a good job on this assignment. I spent several hours coding and sought help and opinions from friends. The challenging part was definitely creating the shapes. It took a while because most of the time, they wouldn't revolve around a circle. However, when they finally came out, they looked really nice.
